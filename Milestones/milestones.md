## Milestone 1: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering (Week 1)

# Tasks:

Collect and clean 7 seasons of player data.
Standardize features across seasons for consistency.
Implement position-specific feature engineering:
FW: Goals p 90, xG, Shots p 90
MF: Assists p 90, Key Passes, Progressive Passes
DF: Tackles Won, Interceptions, % Aerial Duels Won
GK: Saves %, Clean Sheets, Goals Against p 90
Generate rolling averages and breakout season detection.
Store preprocessed data in MongoDB/MySQL.

# Success Criteria:

The dataset is fully processed and ready for modeling.
Players peak performance seasons are identified.

## Milestone 2: Peak Age Prediction & Player Trajectory Graphs (Week 2)

# Tasks:

Train a machine learning model (Random Forest/XGBoost/LSTM) to predict future peak seasons.
Create player trajectory graphs:
Visualize performance trends over time.
Highlight peak seasons and post-peak declines.
Mark breakout seasons for late bloomers.
Build an interactive Streamlit UI:
Users can select a player and see their performance trajectory.
Add filters for position, club, and league.

# Success Criteria:

Users can predict the peak age of a player using historical data.
The UI visualizes career trajectories interactively.

## Milestone 3: Reinforcement Learning for Scouting Decisions (Week 3)

# Tasks:

Implement an RL agent to predict optimal scouting & transfer decisions.
Define state space & reward function:
State Space: Player's past 7-season stats.
Action Space: Scout, Buy, Ignore.
Reward Function:
Positive: Buying an improving player.
Negative: Overpaying for a declining player.
Train the RL model using Q-Learning/PPO.
Integrate scouting predictions into the Streamlit UI.

# Success Criteria:

The RL agent recommends scouting decisions for clubs.
Users can simulate different scouting strategies.

## Milestone 4: Streamlit Deployment & API Integration (Week 4)

# Tasks:

Finalize UI/UX improvements.
Add an API endpoint for external usage:
External apps can fetch player scouting recommendations.
Implement export functionality (player insights to JSON/PDF).
Deploy the project on Streamlit Cloud.
Collect feedback and refine model accuracy.

# Success Criteria:

The project is live on Streamlit Cloud.
Users can interact with player insights, scouting suggestions, and career trajectories.
