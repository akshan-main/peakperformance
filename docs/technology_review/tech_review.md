# **Technology Review: Selecting Python Libraries for Peak Performance Analysis**

## **1. Introduction**
### **Project Overview**
Our project focuses on analyzing and predicting the **peak performance** of football players by examining historical player statistics. The goal is to identify key performance indicators, build predictive models using time-series data, and visualize the results in an interactive and insightful way.

To achieve this, we need to carefully select Python libraries that support:

- **Feature Selection & Importance Analysis**: Identifying the most relevant performance metrics.
- **Deep Learning for Time-Series Forecasting**: Using LSTM models to predict player performance trends.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Making insights more accessible through a user-friendly interface.

## **2. Evaluation of Technology Options**
### **A. Deep Learning Frameworks for LSTM-Based Forecasting**
To train LSTM models for predicting player performance, we compared two widely used deep learning frameworks:

| Feature | TensorFlow/Keras| PyTorch |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Ease of Use |  Simple, high-level API (Keras) | More flexible but requires more manual setup |
| GPU Acceleration |  Fully supported |  Fully supported |
| Performance |  Optimized for production and deployment | Efficient for dynamic computations |
| Community Support |  Large (Google-backed) | Large (Facebook-backed) |
| Debugging | More challenging due to static computation graph |  Easier due to dynamic computation graph |
| Deployment & Scalability | Excellent (TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite) | Limited built-in deployment support |

### **Final Choice:  TensorFlow/Keras**
  - Keras provides an easy-to-use interface for building **LSTM models**.
  - TensorFlow integrates well with **production environments** and offers built-in tools for deployment.
  - It has extensive documentation and a strong developer community.
  - **TensorFlow Serving & TensorFlow Lite** make it easier to deploy at scale.

### **B. Feature Selection & Importance Analysis**
Since we need to determine which performance metrics matter most for peak performance prediction, we analyzed different **feature selection techniques**:

| Feature | Scikit-learn | SHAP | XGBoost Feature Importance |
|---------|-------------|------|----------------------------|
| Ease of Use |  Simple API | More complex to interpret |  Requires tuning |
| Model Compatibility |  Works with all models |  Works with all models |  Limited to tree-based models |
| Performance | Fast | Slower for large datasets | Optimized for trees |
| Explainability |  No direct feature attribution |  Best for interpretability |  Provides feature rankings |

**Final Choice:  Scikit-learn**
- Random Forest feature importance provides a **quick and effective** way to rank features.
- It supports **PCA-based feature selection**, which helps in dimensionality reduction.
- The library is well-documented and integrates easily with our other tools.

### C. Visualization & User Interface  
We compared different options for **visualizing and deploying our results**:

| Feature                | Streamlit | Dash | Flask + D3.js |
|------------------------|----------|------|--------------|
| Interactivity         |  Yes   |  Yes |  Yes |
| Ease of Use           |  Very Easy | Moderate |  Difficult |
| Built-in Widgets      |  Yes   |  No  |  No  |
| Requires Frontend Knowledge |  No  |  Some  |  Yes |
| Deployment Simplicity |  Very Easy |  Moderate |  Complex |
| ML Model Support     |  Yes   |  No  |  No  |
| Live Code Reloading  |  Yes   |  No  |  No  |

**Final Choice: Streamlit**
- **Auto-generates UI** from Python code without writing HTML/CSS.  
- **Includes built-in widgets** (sliders, buttons, file upload, etc.), reducing the need for external libraries.  
- **Live-reloading** feature updates changes instantly while developing.  
- **Minimal coding effort for deployment**, unlike Dash (which needs callbacks) or Flask (which requires frontend development).  
- **Optimized for data science & ML models**, making visualization easy.

## **3. Final Library Selections**
After carefully comparing different options, we have selected the following libraries:

 **TensorFlow/Keras** → For **LSTM-based time-series forecasting**.
 **Scikit-learn** → For **feature importance ranking and selection**.
 **Streamlit** → For **creating an interactive user interface**.

These choices ensure a balance between **performance, ease of use, and compatibility** with our project goals.

## **4. Limitations & Areas of Concern**
| Library | Drawbacks |
|---------|------------|
| TensorFlow/Keras | Debugging can be challenging, and memory usage can be high. |
| Scikit-learn | Lacks advanced explainability compared to SHAP. |
| Streamlit | Limited UI customization compared to Dash. |

Despite these challenges, the selected libraries provide the best combination of functionality and ease of use for our project.

## **5. Demo Plan**
Our demo will include the following components:

 **Training an LSTM model** using TensorFlow/Keras to predict peak player performance.
 **Visualizing feature importance rankings** using Scikit-learn’s Random Forest implementation.
 **Deploying a Streamlit dashboard** to interactively display our results.

---

## **6. Conclusion**
This Technology Review helped us carefully assess the available options and make informed decisions about which Python libraries to use. Our final choices—**TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**—allow us to effectively train models, analyze features, and visualize insights.

By integrating these tools, we will be able to provide an **interactive, data-driven analysis of peak player performance** that is both accurate and accessible.

**Next Steps:**
- Fine-tune our LSTM model for better performance.
- Optimize feature selection to improve interpretability.
- Finalize our Streamlit dashboard for presenting results.
