Questions of interest and goal for the project output:
Football clubs face complex challenges when managing player contracts, transfers, and squad development. Making the right decisions at the right time can mean the difference between long-term success and financial mismanagement. Traditionally, these decisions rely on scouting intuition, historical trends, and financial constraints, often leading to clubs overpaying aging stars, losing young talents too early, or failing to optimize squad depth.

This project proposes an AI-driven approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize strategic transfer and contract decisions. By analyzing match performance, contract details, and market trends, an RL-based agent will simulate multi-season decision-making, helping clubs determine whether to extend a playerâ€™s contract, sell before decline, or loan out for development.

By leveraging player data and predictive modeling, this system will enable clubs to balance performance and financial sustainability. The final outcome will be an interactive dashboard, allowing clubs, analysts, and scouts to simulate different squad-building strategies and make data-backed decisions that align with long-term goals.
